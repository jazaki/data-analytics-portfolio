## My Professional Journey as a Data Analyst

With more and more industries becoming dependent on Data Driven decisions I decided to explore more in the domain of data analytics. Below is the journey that I have taken so far.

### 1. **[Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp-with-r/)**

This course was a great introduction to the world of data science and machine learning. It covered the basics of R programming language and then moved on to the concepts of data science and machine learning. It also covered the basics of data visualization using ggplot2 library. The course also covered the basics of machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, k-means clustering, and natural language processing.

### 2. **Business Analyst**

The course that I pursued enabled me to get a job as a Business Analyst in a startup named [SI Systems](https://www.sisystems.com/). I was responsible for Identifying and prioritizing the organization's functional and technical needs and requirements. Using SQL and Excel to analyze large data sets. Compiling charts, tables, and other elements of data visualization. Creating financial models to support business decisions. Understanding business strategies, goals, and requirements. Planning enterprise architecture (the structure of a business). Forecasting, budgeting, and performing both variance analysis and financial analysis

### 3. **Senior Business Analyst**

I gained a lot of experience in SI Systems in my 3 years of time working for them and thus after 3 years I decided to move on to a new company. I joined [Softech](https://www.softech.com/) as a Senior Business Analyst. Here, I work with colleagues and stakeholders to investigate and model business functions, processes, information flows and data structures, using a range of business analysis techniques.
